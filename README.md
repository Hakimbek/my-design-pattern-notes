# Design Patterns
A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems. That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.

By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable. It is the most important part because java internally follows design patterns.

## Categorization of design patterns:
Basically, design patterns are categorized into two parts:

- Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
- JEE Design Patterns.

## Core Java Design Patterns
In core java, there are mainly three types of design patterns, which are further divided into their sub-parts:

### 1. Creational Design Pattern
- [Factory Method](Creational/Factory)
- [Abstract Factory](Creational/Abstract_Factory)
- [Singleton](Creational/Singleton)
- [Prototype](Creational/Prototype)
- [Builder](Creational/Builder)
### 2. Structural Design Pattern
- [Adapter](Structural/Adapter)
- [Bridge](Structural/Bridge)
- [Composite](Structural/Composite/README.md)
- [Decorator](Structural/Decorator/README.md)
- [Facade](Structural/Facade/README.md)
- [Flyweight](Structural/Fly_Weight/README.md)
- [Proxy](Structural/Proxy/README.md)
### 3. Behavioral Design Pattern
- Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
